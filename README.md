# Breast Cancer Detection 

This project focuses on **Breast Cancer Detection** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.  
The goal is to classify whether a tumor is *malignant* or *benign* using **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)** and **Deep Learning (Neural Network)** approaches.

## üîπ Project Workflow

### 1. Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Handled missing values and scaled features.  
- **Model Training**  
  - Implemented **Logistic Regression** using scikit-learn.  
- **Evaluation**  
  - Measured accuracy and evaluated performance with classification metrics.  
  - Provided a strong baseline for comparison.

### 2. Neural Network (Deep Learning Model)
- **Data Preparation**  
  - Used the same preprocessed dataset.  
- **Model Building**  
  - Designed a feedforward **Neural Network** with input, hidden, and output layers.  
  - Applied activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid) for effective learning.  
- **Training & Validation**  
  - Trained with backpropagation and optimization.  
  - Visualized training vs validation accuracy/loss curves.  
- **Performance**  
  - Achieved higher accuracy than Logistic Regression and better generalization.
